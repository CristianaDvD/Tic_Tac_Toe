## User Experience

Tic tac toe, known as well as noughts and crosses or Xs and Os, is a game in which two players alternately use X or O to designate the spaces on a three-by-three grid. The winner is the first player to place three of their markers in a row, either diagonally, vertically, or horizontally. The game is solved, and a forced draw is assumed if both players play to their best abilities.
